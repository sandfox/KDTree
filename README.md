KDTree
======

This is a very simple and non-efficient implementation of KD-Trees for PHP. At the moment this mostly just a proof of concept.
It's slightly buggy and needs some test written for it. Later I plan on either making this faster or producing a fast (and probably ugly) version for production usage. In the meantine if you require a speedy implemenation I strongly suggest using an another language for this (node.js or C).

Pull Requests are more than welcome
